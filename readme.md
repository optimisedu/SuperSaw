** Basic unison/supersaw implimentation in this case.
Creates two arrays of oscillators detuned in opposite directions based on their index number. #
Pans one array left and the other right for stereo for classic widening effect.

Ideas - 
- Add controls for detune amount, number of oscillators, waveform type.
- Add UI elements for real-time control.
- Modulate - I am currently taking appart different synthesisizers I have created in the past, and improving their flexibility.
my long term goal with this is to create a modular sythesis framework/library in vanilla js
- Plenty of space for optimisation. Regarding the modulation as well - as this can be seen as a unison "plugin" there is probably a MUCH better way of visualising this
